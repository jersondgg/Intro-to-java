/*
Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer a, and 
then a positive integer d. Assume the user enters valid input.  The program then
outputs the quotient of a  divided by d and the remainder of  a divided by d . 
The program then does the same thing again, and keeps doing it until the quotient
and remainder are the same.
